# EarLink Interface: Exploring Novel Input Mechanisms through Tensor Tympani Muscle
Welcome to the EarLink project, a journey into innovative ways of interfacing with computers and machines using the natural capabilities of your ears.

**Introduction**
Earphones are popular among consumers, providing a private audio experience for various activities like listening to music, podcasts, or making hands-free calls. Smart earphones, known as Earables, equipped with sensors and real-time data capabilities, offer novel ways to interact with mobile devices, especially in situations where users are preoccupied or in public spaces. In mobile contexts, subtle and motionless input gestures are favored due to social considerations, avoiding the inconvenience of large physical gestures and maintaining privacy by reducing unwanted attention. Earables can detect input through various means, such as tapping the earphone or recognizing advanced gestures performed around the ear. This introduces a unique opportunity for interaction, including utilizing in-ear barometry to detect head gestures. However, there are challenges regarding social acceptability and the need for more discreet input methods using the earable medium.

**Project Highlights:**
- **Ear Interface:** Our focus is on harnessing the potential of your ears as a unique input mechanism.

- **Ear Muscle Activation:** We explore the activation of the tensor tympani muscle in your middle ear, which can produce a low-level rumbling sound when triggered.

- **Diverse Use Cases:** EarLink has the potential to control a wide range of devices and software, from assistive technology to gaming and even machine control.

- **Accessibility Focus:** Our primary goal is to help people with disabilities communicate and interact with technology using EarLink. However, we believe it can be useful for anyone looking for innovative input methods.

**Current Progress:**
- **Proof of Concept:** We've demonstrated control of software such as the Windows on-screen keyboard, Grid3 assistive software, and head tracking utilities using tensor tympani muscle activation.

- **Future Possibilities:** We're considering alternative motion detection methods, such as using a CMOS camera or thermal imaging.

**Quick Fact:** When you clench your eyes tightly or yawn widely, you might notice a rumbling sound in your ears, similar to distant thunder. This intriguing phenomenon is due to the tensor tympani muscle. The tensor tympani muscle's primary role is to protect your ears from loud sounds, like chewing and even thunder. When activated, it tightens the eardrums, preventing them from vibrating and potential damage. However, it may not respond quickly enough to shield against sudden loud sounds.
