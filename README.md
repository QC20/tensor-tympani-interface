# EarLink Interface: Exploring Novel Input Mechanisms through Tensor Tympani Muscle

**Quick Fact:** When you clench your eyes tightly or yawn widely, you might notice a rumbling sound in your ears, similar to distant thunder. This intriguing phenomenon is due to the tensor tympani muscle.

The tensor tympani muscle's primary role is to protect your ears from loud sounds, like chewing and even thunder. When activated, it tightens the eardrums, preventing them from vibrating and potential damage. However, it may not respond quickly enough to shield against sudden loud sounds.

**# EarLink: Exploring Innovative Ear Interface ðŸ¦»

Welcome to the EarLink project, a journey into innovative ways of interfacing with computers and machines using the natural capabilities of your ears.

**Project Highlights:**
- **Ear Interface:** Our focus is on harnessing the potential of your ears as a unique input mechanism.

- **Ear Muscle Activation:** We explore the activation of the tensor tympani muscle in your middle ear, which can produce a low-level rumbling sound when triggered.

- **Diverse Use Cases:** EarLink has the potential to control a wide range of devices and software, from assistive technology to gaming and even machine control.

- **Accessibility Focus:** Our primary goal is to help people with disabilities communicate and interact with technology using EarLink. However, we believe it can be useful for anyone looking for innovative input methods.

**Current Progress:**
- **Proof of Concept:** We've demonstrated control of software such as the Windows on-screen keyboard, Grid3 assistive software, and head tracking utilities using tensor tympani muscle activation.

- **Ongoing Development:** We're working on scaling down the setup by using a smaller otoscope and making it more robust by integrating the camera inside a noise-canceling earpiece shell.

- **Future Possibilities:** We're considering alternative motion detection methods, such as using a CMOS camera or thermal imaging.

**Join Our Journey:** We invite you to explore the project, try out the technology, and share your thoughts with us. Together, we can unlock the potential of EarLink as a new and accessible ear-based input mechanism.

*Note: The project is inspired by the work of Nick G, who first experimented with tensor tympani muscle activation as an input method. We aim to build upon this exciting exploration.*
